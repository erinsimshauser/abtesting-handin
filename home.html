      <h3>A/B Testing: Which Interface performs better?</h3>
    </div>
    <div class='section'>
      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p>The goal of this project was to gain experience in A/B testing and understand the statistical methods
        used to inform design decisions. I made slight changes to a web interface, gathered user data, and then
        analyzed which website performed better according to my metrics.

      <h1>Hypotheses</h1>
      <!-- For each metric, write a set of hypotheses (null and alternative hypotheses), 
        making sure to include your reasoning behind the alternative hypotheses.
         The reasoning should relate to the changes you made. -->

      <h1>Data collection</h1>
      <!-- To collect data, you will send this link to your peers for data collection. 
        Your Heroku link will randomly select interface A or B for users to complete. 
        Regardless of which version a user gets, their task should be to fill their cart with at least $150 of cacti/succulents. 
        If you so choose, you may also collect data from people who are not in CS1300 (you can send your Heroku link to others, and they can complete the task). 
        Describe your data collection process in 2-3 sentences. -->

      <h1>Takeaways</h1>
      <!-- Then, in 2-4 bullet points, describe your broad takeaways on general A/B testing from this assignment. These are some points that may be good to address:
What limitations do you think affected the results of your test?
What do your results tell us about design principles in general (think affordances, navigation, etc.)? -->
