      <h3>A/B Testing: Which Interface performs better?</h3>
    </div>
    <div class='section'>
      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p>The goal of this project was to gain experience in A/B testing and understand the statistical methods
        used to inform design decisions. I made slight changes to a web interface, gathered user data, and then
        analyzed which website performed better according to my metrics.

      <h1>Websites Tested</h1>
      <p>View the website <a href="https://calm-ravine-88425.herokuapp.com/">here</a>. Refresh to see the different versions!</p>

      <h2>Key Changes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Image size is bigger on B</li>
        <li>Cacti are orderd by descending price on B rather than ascending price on A</li>
        <li>Button text color and cart match the visual design (color) on B</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class='section'>
      <h1>Hypotheses</h1>
      <h2>Time to Completion</h2>
      <p>Time to completion defined as how long it took a user to put $150 worth of cacti into their cart</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Null Hypothesis:</b> There is no difference in time to completion between version A and version B</li>
        <li><b>Alternative Hypothesis:</b> Version B will have a shorter time to completion because the cacti are orderd from high to low price which will make it easier to spend more compared to version A</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Return Rate</h2>
      <p>Return rate defined as whether or not a user returned to the shopping screen after the checkout screen</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Null Hypothesis:</b> There is no difference in return rate between version A and version B</li>
        <li><b>Alternative Hypothesis:</b>There will be a difference in return rate between version A and version B because version B is more visually appealing and inviting with larger image size and more consistent visual design</li>
      </ul>
      <!-- For each metric, write a set of hypotheses (null and alternative hypotheses), 
        making sure to include your reasoning behind the alternative hypotheses.
         The reasoning should relate to the changes you made. -->

      <h1>Data collection</h1>
      <p>I sent my website to peers in my UI/UX class. Each person was tasked with putting $150 worth of cacti into
        their cart. Users did not know which version of the website they were getting and both versions had the same task to perform.
        I then downloaded the raw data from Heroku and extrapolated my desired metrics from analyzing the log times and page loads.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class='section'>
      <h1>Results</h1>
      <p>I created and ran python scripts on my data to perfrom an independent sample t-test for time to completion
        and a chi squared test for return rate. I have summarized the revelant findings and results in an infographic below.

      <h1>Takeaways</h1>
      <h2>General</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>I learned about the value of statistics in evaluating UI decisions. Even though 
          my average time to completions were different, they were not statistically significantly different.
        </li>
        <li>I would like to perform more A/B testing in the future, especially on a website/app used in real life</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Limitations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>I only had data from 24 users total, which may not have been a large enough sample size to formulate results</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Design Principles</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>It is important to have a consistent visual design style (such as color) because this can result in
          a statistically significant difference in the percentage of users who want to return to your site
        </li>
      </ul>
